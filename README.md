# My Portfolio Website - Challenge 2

## Description

The challenge for this assignment was to create a portfolio webpage to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. This portfolio highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. 

In this project I learned how to practice:
- Flexbox: To make layouts more user friendly and implement responsive web design.
- Media queries: To optimize layouts for different device screen sizes.
- CSS variables: To keep code clean and implement advance CSS styling.

In addition, I continued to practice implementing accessibility elements for those with screen readers or similar accessibility devices with alt attribute.
